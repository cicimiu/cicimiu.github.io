PROJECT EXPERIENCE                 		  
SASA Cosmetic Store Queue System                                                                                                                               Hong Kong	
Compared the efficiency of single-line and multi-line queuing models by  C++ and Matlab                                        Oct 2014
Collected 200+ pieces of real-life data through on-site observation at a SASA Cosmetic Store
Analyzed the distribution pattern of the inter-arrival time and service time through Chi-square Goodness of fit Test.  
Simulated two models by generating 100 groups of data as input and compared the output of two models 
Optimized the model by building a dynamic model to control the average waiting time and queue length.
